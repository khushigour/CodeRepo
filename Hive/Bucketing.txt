Maintaining Data Consistency:

Updates and Inserts: Avoid updating or inserting individual records in a bucketed table, as it can disrupt the bucketing scheme. Instead, perform bulk inserts or overwrite the entire table to maintain bucketing consistency.

Sorting: If the data needs to be sorted within each bucket, make sure to sort the data before inserting it into the table. Sorting after insertion can lead to incorrect bucketing and compromised query performance.
